# Getting Started

In this Lab, youâ€™ll get handsâ€‘on with the SQL database in Microsoft Fabric. We'll begin by setting up a Fabric SQL database and loading sample data followed by trying out the Copilot-assisted querying (including NL2SQL). From there, you'll learn how to expose your data through APIs, connect seamlessly to applications, analytics and Power BI, and explore building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using SQL database in Microsoft Fabric.

 The focus of this lab is to understand how to design, build, and operationalize end-to-end AI-ready applications using SQL database in Fabric as the core data backbone.

Our final system architecture will look similar to the following:

In each module, you'll get more references, which you should follow up on to learn more. Also, watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.

## âœ… Learning Objectives

In this workshop you'll learn:

- How to create a Fabric SQL database, load sample datasets, query data, and replicate it with OneLake  
- How to use Microsoft Copilot for query correction, natural language to SQL (NL2SQL), and interactive chat-based data exploration  
- How to expose your SQL data through a GraphQL endpoint and integrate it with modern applications    
- How to implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns to enhance AI responses with live SQL data
