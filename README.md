## üî•LAB533: Develop Scalable Data Solutions with SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric

Welcome to the comprehensive hands-on lab for Microsoft Ignite 2025! This lab will guide you through building end-to-end AI-ready applications using SQL database in Microsoft Fabric as the core data backbone.

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you'll get hands-on experience with SQL database in Microsoft Fabric, exploring how to design, build, and operationalize scalable data solutions. You'll learn to leverage Copilot-assisted querying, implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with Azure OpenAI, build GraphQL APIs, and create Power BI reports - all integrated within the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem.

### üß† Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you will:

- **Create and configure** SQL databases in Microsoft Fabric.
- **Leverage Copilot capabilities** for enhanced T-SQL development and natural language querying.
- **Implement RAG applications** using vector embeddings and semantic similarity search.
- **Build GraphQL APIs** for modern application integration with AI-powered responses.
- **Create Power BI reports** using semantic models from SQL analytics endpoints.
- **Understand end-to-end architecture** for AI-ready data solutions in Microsoft Fabric.

## Lab Modules
